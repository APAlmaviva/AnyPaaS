# **AnyPaaS**

This project aims to create a set of classes to be used within applications destined to be used on the main public Cloud Providers that allows the use of services typically offered in PaaS without necessarily being linked to the specific provider.

For example it will be possible to perform logging by calling up a single log interface that will use Application Insight if the application is deployed on Azure, CloudWatch if deployed on AWS.
